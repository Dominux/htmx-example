# HTMX-example

### Dependencies:

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) _(1.21 or higher)_

### Commands

```bash
go run main.go
```

Once the server is run (usually takes less than a second) simply go to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Description

Made by [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9H6vYelYyU). No dependencies needed (golang tooling already has all we need built-in). Everything runs on a single server without any js used.
